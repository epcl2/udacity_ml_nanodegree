# Udacity ML Nanodegree Projects

This repository contains my projects for the Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree.

###### Sentiment Analysis Project  
This project consists of building and deploying a (PyTorch) RNN model that predicts the sentiment of a movie review using Amazon SageMaker. A simple web app that accepts user input is also created to interact with the deployed model.
